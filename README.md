🔍 Task 3 Completed – Clustering Analysis: Customer Segmentation
💼 Python Data Analysis Intern at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

I’m excited to share the results of Task 3 of my data analysis internship, where I explored customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

📌 Objective:
To group customers based on purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering, enabling businesses to design targeted marketing strategies.

🧪 Key Steps Involved:

Dataset Used: customer_data.csv

Exploratory Analysis: Checked dataset shape, missing values, duplicates, and summary statistics using Pandas and Seaborn.

Data Preprocessing: Standardized features like Age, Income, and Spending Score using StandardScaler to ensure effective clustering.

Clustering Techniques:

Used Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Applied K-Means Clustering and labeled each customer accordingly.

Visualization:

Reduced dimensions using PCA for 2D cluster visualization.

Created scatter plots, pair plots, and visualized cluster centroids for better interpretability.

📊 This task sharpened my understanding of unsupervised learning, especially in real-world customer segmentation scenarios.
